    "Finding Distinctive Words with TF-IDF in Scientific Abstracts\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll apply TF-IDF to scientific abstracts, to extract the critical information addressed in each excerpt. This is a handy tool for sorting through original literature sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF weighs words based on two factors:\n",
    "-- Term Frequency (TF): How often a word appears in a document, normalized by the document's length (gathers words relative importance within the document)\n",
    "-- Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): How rare the word is across all documents. Words that appear in many documents (like \"the\" or \"study\") receive lower IDF scores. Specialized terms receive higher scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF aims to highlight words that are frequent in a specific document and relatively unique across the corpus. TF-IDF helps with:\n",
    "- Identifying field-specific terminology in academic literature\n",
    "- Extracting keywords from documents\n",
    "- Building search engines that return relevant results\n",
